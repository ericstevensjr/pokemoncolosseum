# Pokemon Colosseum
## University of North Florida
## Eric Stevens Jr.
## Introduction to A.I. Project #1

### Information
I created 4 different .py files and seperated the major classes that way. 

Virtual environment named "MyEnv" was used on my Windows 11 Computer using command line, in the virtual environment I ran Python 3.11.0. I ran the virtual enviornment using the command, in the project folder:
    > MyEnv\Scripts\activate

Development environment was command prompt, Visual Studio Code, and Git.

To run the program on the command line the way I did, after the virtual enviornment is running, use the command:
    > python.exe PokemonColosseum.py

I did not use any other packages in the development of this project.

After the programming is running, just follow the directions on the command line. To run the program, re-enter the command above. I unfortunately did not implement a user-prompt for restarting the game.
